# Sample Slurm job script
#   for TACC Stampede2 KNL nodes
#
#   ** OpenMP Job on Normal Queue **
#
# Last revised: 20 Oct 2017
#
# Notes:
#
#   -- Launch this script by executing
#   -- Copy/edit this script as desired.  Launch by executing
#      sbatch knl.openmp.slurm on a Stampede2 login node.
#
#   -- OpenMP codes run on a single node (upper case N = 1).
#        OpenMP ignores the value of lower case n,
#        but slurm needs a plausible value to schedule the job.
#
#   -- Default value of OMP_NUM_THREADS is 1; be sure to change it!
#
#   -- Increase thread count gradually while looking for optimal setting.
#        If there is sufficient memory available, the optimal setting
#        is often 68 (1 thread per core) or 136 (2 threads per core).
