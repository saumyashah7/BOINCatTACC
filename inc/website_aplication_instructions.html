<h3 id="jobsubmissionthroughwebsite">7. Steps for Running Additional Applications from the Website</h2>

<h4 id="prerequisites"><strong>Prerequisites</strong></h4>

<p>
  Instructions below should be run from the BOINC@TACC Job Submission page, researchers must be registered for using BOINC@TACC and should log into this website with their TACC portal credentials.
</p>

<p>
  The researchers should complete the one-time registration process for using BOINC@TACC by running a script from the Stampede2/Lonestar5 systems as shown below:
</p>

<pre><code class="bash language-bash">curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ritua2/BOINCatTACC/master/stampede2-backend/register-boinc.sh;
chmod +x advance-submit.sh;
./register-boinc.sh;</code></pre>



<h4 id="accessingthetutorialfilesforspecificapplications"><strong>Tutorial files for TACC specific applications</strong></h4>

<p>
  A sample exercise for each specific application is provided below. All the necessary files are available when cloning the github repo as per the above instructions. However, for users wishing to use only one application, follow the instructions below:
